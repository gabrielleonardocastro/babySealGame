        <p class="description">Sisyphus is/was a baby seal who twice avoided *sure* death when escaping the evil clubs of the exotic leather boot makers. Being an avid swimmer, he became somewhat of a thrill seeker, who purposely taunted whaling ships and poachers. One day, he provoked the wrong pontoon, and by Zeus's bidding, happened to be impaled by a harpoon. He survived, yet suffered from a very unfortunate injury, especially for an aquatic mammal. A punctured lung, resulted in his inability to hold his breath like other seals, effectively cursing him to live at/near the surface of the water at ALL times, as to not drown. Unluckily for him, this resulted in a constant having to dive under endless propeller-powered boats as to not be shredded into fishermen's chum. This game is meant to recreate the seemingly endless (and pointless) torture bequeathed unto him by one of the pettiest, most unjust Gods in recorded history. Join him on his epic journey and experience a taste of mind-numbing eternal torment!</p>
